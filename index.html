    <h2>informashin for hero</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a character with extraordinary powers that performs heroic actions. Unlike police, firefighters or doctors, all of whom are heroes in their own right, superheroes are defined by their unique capabilities, such flight, strength, speed or invincibility (to name a few). Superheroes are also expected to act on a strict moral code.,</p>
    <p>If you are wondering if superheroes are real or not, let us assure you that there is no such thing as a superhero in real life like we have in movies. No billionaire guy is dressing like an animal to beat criminals or an alien from a faraway planet that can fly and shoot laser from his eyes.</p>
